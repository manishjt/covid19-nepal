# Summary
The summary below focusses more on the method and less so on the results and coclusions. Please let me (Biswas Sharma) know if you have questions or comments.

* With the rationale that undocumented infections 
	* often have symptoms that are mild, limited, or absent,
	* hence go unrecognized, and 	
	* can expose a far greater portion of population to virus (compared to that by documented infections)

* Estimate:
	1. **fraction** of *undocumented* infections (prior to Wuhan travel shutdown)
		Results:
		* 86% of all infections
		* 95% Cl: [82%-90%]
		
	2. **contagiousness** of *undocumented* infections
		Results:
		* 52% as contagious as *documented* infections (Cl [44%-69%])
		* 79% of *documentd* cases resulted from *undocumented* infections
		* R<sub>0</sub> ~ 2.23 ([1.77-3.00]) before travel restrictions and control measures

	
* By using:
	* **observations** (within China) of:
		1. *reported* infections 
		2.  spread
			* daily number of travelers between 375 cities in specified period
				* ala Tencent Location-based Service (LBS)
				* used data from previous year to represent mobility in current year
			* number of travel events underreported, corrected by using a >1 factor \theta 
	* in conjunction with **model-inference framework** involving:
		1. Metapopulation model
			* networked
				* 375 nodes (Chinese cities)
			* dynamic
				* simulates spatio-temporal dynamics
			* metapopulation structure as in Fig. 1, including:
			* **4 model state variables** corresponding to each node, *i*:
				* susceptible (*S</sub>i<sub>*)
				* exposed (*E<sub>i</sub>*)
					* initial for origin node (*E<sub>Wuhan</sub>*): drawn from uniform distr. [0, *Seed<sub>max</sub>*]
						* *Seed<sub>max</sub>* ranged [500, 600] between simulations
					* initial for other nodes: *E<sub>i</sub>* = *C<sub>i</sub>**E<sub>Wuhan</sub>*/*N<sub>Wuhan</sub>*, where *C<sub>i</sub>* is the number of travelers from origin node to node *i*
				* documented infected (*I<sub>i</sub><sup>r</sup>*)
					* patients with symptoms severe enough to be confirmed
					* assumed to *not* move between nodes
					* initial for origin node: (*I<sub>Wuhan</sub><sup>r</sup>*) = 0
						* EAKF adjustment can account for the effects of actual initial >0
					* initial for other nodes: (*I<sub>i</sub><sup>r</sup>*) = 0
					* delays in infection confirmation (*t<sub>d</sub>* in days) accounted for by defining observation model using a Poisson process (Poission distr. with mean *T<sub>d</sub>* -- ranged [4 *days*, 12 *days*] between simulations -- used to draw *t<sub>d</sub>* for each new case)

				* undocumented infected (*I<sub>i</sub><sup>u</sup>*)
					* patients with symptoms *not* severe enough to be confirmed
					* initial for origin node (*I<sub>Wuhan</sub><sup>u</sup>*): drawn from uniform distr. [0, *Seed<sub>max</sub>*]
						* *Seed<sub>max</sub>* ranged [500, 600] between simulations
					* initial for other nodes: (*I<sub>i</sub><sup>u</sup>*) = *C<sub>i</sub>**I<sub>Wuhan</sub><sup>u</sup>*/*N<sub>Wuhan</sub>*,
			* 5th variable: total current population (*N<sub>i</sub>*) in each node using spacial coupling represented by daily number of people traveling from node i to node j (*M<sub>ij</sub>*)
			* **6 parameters** (prior ranges drawn from *uniform distributions* of ranges as listed under each parameter):
				* transmission rate due to documented infected individuals (*\beta*)
					* initial prior before intervention: [0.6, 1.5]
					* initial prior after intervention: [0.2, 1.0]
				* transmission rate due to undocumented infected individuals (*\mu**\beta*)
					* *\beta* reduced by factor *\mu*
					* initial prior (*\mu*): [0.2, 1]
				* fraction of documented infections (*\alpha*)
					* initial prior before intervention: [0.02, 0.8]
					* initial prior after intervention: [0.2, 1.0]
				* average latency period (*Z*)
					* initial prior: [2, 5] *days*
				* average duration of infection (*D*)
					* initial prior: [2, 5] *days*
				* multiplicative factor to reflect underreporting of movements (*\theta*)
					* initial prior before intervention: [1, 1.75]
					* *\theta* = 0 after intervention
				
				* Note: reproduction number calculated as
					*R<sub>E</sub> = \alpha\betaD + (1 - \alpha)\mu\betaD*
				
			* **Model used to estimate trajectories of the 4 state variables** (for all 375 nodes): *S</sub>i<sub>*, *E<sub>i</sub>*, *I<sub>i</sub><sup>r</sup>*, *I<sub>i</sub><sup>u</sup>*
			
							
		2. Bayesian inference
			* IF-EAKF (iterated filter-ensemble adjustment Kalman filter) framework
			* **Infer 6 model parameters** (simultaneously while estimating above four state variables): *Z* *D* *\mu*, *\beta*, *\alpha*, *\theta*
			* Best-fitting model-inference posterior identified by **log-likelihood**
				

		
* Wih conclusions:
	* majority of infections undocumented
	* substantial contribution of undocumentd infections in virus transmission
	* reduction of overall infection associated with:
		* heightened awareness of outbreak
		* increased use of personal protective measures
		* travel restriction
	* unclear sufficiency of aforementioned reduction in stemming virus spread
